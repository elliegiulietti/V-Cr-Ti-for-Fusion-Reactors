## Sample Preparation

To prepare for the experiment, the alloys had to be cut and mounted. The V44 and V1515 samples came pre-made as buttons.
All preparation for the samples was performed in the Materials Micropreparation Laboratory at the University of Sheffield. 
The first V44 samples for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 were halved on the Secotom 50 cutting machine, the V1515 sample, was cut on the Isomet 5000. 
All samples were mounted in conductive bakelite on the Simplimet Mounting Press 1000. 
They were then ground using standard micropreparation steps on the Automet 250, the final grinding value was to 1200 grit. 

## Design of Experiments (DOE)

To design an experiment which explores a range of the two variables, laser power and laser speed, a design of experiment (DOE) was employed. 
Using statistical software, Minitab 20, a DOE was created by inputting a maximum and minimum value for the laser speed and powers, in mm/s and Watts respectively. 
There are two main designs for the DOE, these are Box-Behnken and Central Composite designs. 
Central Composite design was employed as only two parameters were being varied. 
On the Minitab software, Central Composite was selected using a quadratic design with axial input of maximum and minimum values. 
The maximum and minimum input values for Minitab of the laser speed and power for the experiments are displayed in Table 1.

| Experiments   | Condition | Laser Speed (mm/s) | Laser Power (W) |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Experiment 1  | Max       | 2000               | 390             |
|               | Min       | 500                | 150             |
| Experiment 2  | Max       | 1750               | 235             |
|               | Min       | 500                | 65              |
| Experiment 3  | Max       | 2000               | 390             |
|               | Min       | 500                | 150             |

## DOE Experiment 1 V44 alloy

The values for the DOE are based on the maximum and minimum operating values of the LPBF machine. 
This is the first experiment of its sort to be tested with the alloys, V44 and V1515, it is important to initially test a wide range of values to understand how the alloys are affected by the parameters.
The values created by the DOE for the initial experiment can be seen in [Design of Experiment with Power and Speed variables for Experiment 1 with V44 alloy](DOE_Experiment_1). 

## DOE Experiment 2 V44 alloy

Experiment 1 on V44 showed that the higher performance results were those of sample 1-9, which had a speed of 1250 mm/s and a power of 150 W, discussed further in [results](image_url). 
Experiment 2 was influenced by the higher performance outcomes observed in Experiment 1, the central values of Experiment 2 closely aligned with the optimal values identified in Experiment 1. 
For Experiment 2, two DOE's were created, one consisting of a larger range and another having a smaller range of values to hone in on the optimum conditions seen in Experiment 1. 
Both DOE's were centered around 150 W power and a 1125 mm/s speed. 
The DOE can be seen in [Design of Experiment with Power and Speed variables for Experiment 2 with V44 alloy](DOE_Experiment_2).

## DOE Experiment 3 V1515 alloy

Experiment 3 was designed with a smaller range, again influenced by the higher performance outcomes of Experiment 1. 
Experiment 3 tested the V1515 alloy, hence a larger range of values were used, similar to the initial values in Experiment 1 to test a higher range, with centre values of 270 W for laser power and 1250 mm/s for laser speed. 
An additional DOE was created with a smaller range, centered around the higher performance values derived from Experiment 1, with centre values of 185 W for laser power and 1125 mm/s for laser speed.
This is due to the likelihood that the V1515 alloy would yield similar outcomes to those of the V44 alloy in Experiment 1. 
The DOE can be seen in [Design of Experiment with Power and Speed variables for Experiment 3 with V44 alloy](DOE_Experiment_3).
