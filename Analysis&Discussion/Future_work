### Predicted Future Work

Future studies could focus on comparing data from vanadium alloys with similar alloys popular for current additive manufacturing methods. By performing identical tests on these samples, qualitative assessment of the viability of vanadium alloys can be performed.

If time and resources permit, obtaining more SEM images of all melt track cross-sections and performing crack density studies on these images will allow for comparison with crack density studies on the top-view optical samples, providing insights and observing differences. Employing the Box-Behnken and composite design DOE's to test parameters such as hatch spacing and beam radius would be valuable, as these parameters are known to influence outcomes. The analysis of crack types can be challenging without data on alloy microstructural properties and grain boundary precipitates. Future efforts could focus on obtaining this information to analyze crack types.

The qualitative nature of crack type determination brings subjectivity and uncertainty, which could be avoided using advanced imaging techniques or automated analysis algorithms. Further investigation into the microstructural properties of vanadium alloys could provide deeper insights into crack formation mechanisms, enhancing additive manufacturing processes.

Exploring the melting behavior of vanadium alloy powder in additive manufacturing processes is crucial. The melting of metal differs significantly from that of powder particles, understanding the behavior of vanadium alloy powder under laser melting conditions is essential for process optimization. However, there are increased risks associated with handling powder, including inhalation hazards. Considering the limited availability of vanadium as a mass-produced material, this may be a challenge, but it remains an important consideration for future research.

Finally, there is a need to refine laser parameters by testing with lower power settings and different speed combinations to build upon the results gained throughout this study. By systematically varying these parameters, we can understand their impact on the additive manufacturing process and the resulting material properties. By adding hatch spacing and more refined laser parameters into the DOE, valuable data can be gained and could contribute to the development of advanced alloys for additive manufacturing.
