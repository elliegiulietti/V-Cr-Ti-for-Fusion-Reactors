# Analysis 
For crack type analysis, the three types of solid state cracks (SSC), strain age crack, ductility-dip crack and cold cracks, will all be categorised as SSC unless the crack type is very clear, differentiating between the three generally requires further analysis. Similarly for solidification cracks (SC) and liquation cracks (LC), they will be grouped together and identified as SC throughout the analysis and discussion. To differentiate between SC and LC, more information about the V44 and V1515 alloys and their grain boundary phases is required, visually the two crack types are similar and both occur in the same phase, unlike SSC. 
The crack analysis of the images can be seen in [Collage of optical top view images with crack types and visible deformations defined from a to f showing the different melt tracks. Solidification Cracking (SC), Solid-State Cracking (SSC), Cold Cracking (CC)](Analysis&Discussion
/Crack type collage.pdf)
, where examples of SC and SSC are highlighted on the melt tracks. 

## Error Analysis
The analysis of the samples was conducted through two methodologies: quantitative crack density measurement and a qualitative visual assessment for crack type determination. By using qualitative and quantitative methods, the analysis can provide a comprehensive understanding of the samples, with numerical data (crack density) and observations (crack type). Each method carries its own set of potential errors, which are important to acknowledge for the sake of result interpretation and analysis.
For crack density assessment, ImageJ 1.54h software was used with the optical images taken on the Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision software.

This involved uploading the image, measuring the area of interest, and subsequently measuring the length of individual cracks. 
The total crack length per unit area gave the crack density,
Crack density is measured in $mm/mm^2$, crack length in $mm$, and the area of interest in $mm^2$. 
However, there is the possibility of human error, particularly in crack length measurement. 
The error will be systematic, and its consistency across the results ensures the comparability of the data.

Despite the defined crack characteristics, there is subjectivity in qualitative analysis. The analysis involved considering several factors, including the crack's boundary or edge, with relation to its origin. Feature size is also crucial, as microcracks may exist, which will not be visible in all surface images. Both the length and width of the crack are important to consider, as are subsurface cracks. Each identified crack type is a probable estimation rather than a definitive classification, hence, there is an uncertainty in the crack type. 

## Experiment 1 Analysis

The evaluated results for Experiment 1 can be seen in [Table 1](#exp-1-results-table), where the laser speed and power with the respective crack density and crack type can be seen.
