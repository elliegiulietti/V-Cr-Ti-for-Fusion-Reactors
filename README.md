## Overview

Vanadium Alloys for Fusion Reactors: Assessing Their Viability for Additive Manufacturing

This repository holds the infromation from a General Engineering Masters dissertation from the University of Sheffield by Ellie Giulietti, May 2024. 

## Project Summary

Vanadium alloys are proving to be a useful material in nuclear fusion reactors, they exhibit structural durability and irradiation resistance at high temperatures in challenging environments, such as a nuclear reactor. Among other design challenges and avenues to explore, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has highlighted the importance of understanding the feasibility of vanadium alloys for additive manufacturing procedures. Additive manufacturing is a growing manufacturing method compared to the current subtractive manufacturing methods, hence prompting this project's study.

This project has explored the vanadium alloys, V44 (V-4Cr-4Ti) and V1515 (V-15Cr-15Ti), focusing on a preliminary study of the viability for additive manufacturing (AM) procedures. The focus of the study will be to assess crack susceptibility through a series of laser melt track tests on a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) machine. Prior to the experimental procedures, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted to further the understanding of vanadium alloys, additive manufacturing procedures, and nuclear fusion.

The aims and objectives for this project are shown below.

**Key aim:** To investigate the viability of vanadium alloys, V44 and V1515, for additive manufacturing (AM) procedures using melt track tests, for the application of fusion reactors.

**Objectives:**

1. Review and analyze literature to determine the most suitable additive manufacturing procedure of vanadium alloys for the application of fusion reactors.

2. Establish a set of reactor and material requirements for vanadium alloys.

3. Investigate the impact of laser parameters, speed and power, on the microstructure and crack formation on the vanadium alloys.

4. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), determine if the vanadium alloys are suitable for AM procedures.

5. Collect and organize experimental results and findings into a useful resource for the scientific community to be used in future investigations.

Following an extensive literature review, three melt track tests were done to assess the viability of vanadium alloys, V44 and V1515, for additive manufacturing (AM). The AM machine used was an Aconity Lab LPBF machine. 

## Usage

The melt track tests were set up using a deign of experiments, varying two laser parameters- laser power and laser speed. The set up procedure and sample preparation can be seen in [Experimental set up](Experiment_set-up/Experiment-set-up.md)

The results of the tests were in the form of microscope images using Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision at the Royce Bulding, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images using at the University of Sheffield. The raw results can be seen in [Results](Results/Results.md)

The results were analysed using qualitative and quantative methods. Qualitative included identifying the crack types in the melt tracks, and quantative analysis was through ImageJ software and determining the crack density. The analysis and discussion of the results can be seen in [Analysis](Analysis&Discussion/Analysis.md)

Future work proposed for the study of V44 and V1515 alloys with respect to nuclear fusion applications and additive manufacturing procedures can be seen in [Analysis&Discussion/Future Predicted work](Future_work.md)
