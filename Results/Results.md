## Results 

The optical microscope images were taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision software at the Royce Discovery Center in the University of Sheffield.

## Experiment 1 Results

Experiment 1 tested the V44 alloy.

Melt tracks 1-4 and 1-5 were not visible through the top- view optical microscope images due to an uneven and blackened surface, preventing microscope focus.
The optical results can be seen in [Experiment 1 using Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision top-view images of melt tracks, 20X lens 100um scale. a) to h) showing the different track reference numbers and their corresponding laser parameters.]()
Due to time and resource limitations, SEM analysis of Experiment 1 was unfeasible. However the halved and prepared samples were analysed under the optical microscope (Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision).

## Experiment 2 Results

Experiment 2 tested the V44 alloy.

The optical microscope for top-view optical imaging taken on the Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision are displayed in [Experiment 2 V44 using Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision top-view images of melt tracks for lower powers, 20X lens 100um scale. a) to h) showing the different track reference numbers and their corresponding laser parameters.]()
Melt track tests for the V44 sample subject to a higher laser power are shown in [Experiment 2 using Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision top-view images of melt tracks for higher power, 20X lens 100um scale. i) to q) showing the different track reference numbers and their corresponding laser parameters.]()
SEM images are displayed in \autoref{fig:EXP-2 SEM}, showing the cross section of the V44 sample. Due to constraints in time and resources, SEM imaging could not be conducted for every melt track. However the obtained images show the tracks with minimal cracking, as these parameters are presumed to be optimal for additive manufacturing (AM) of vanadium. 
SEM images are shown in [SEM imaging of Experiment 2 cross section, a) 2-1 BSE mag 20000 x, b) 2-1 SE mag 20000 x, c) 2-2 SE mag 20000 x, d) 2-2 SE mag 80000 x, e) 2-5 SE mag 5000 x, f) 2-6 SE mag 10000 x, g) 2-7 SE mag 10000 x, h) 2-8 SE mag 20000 x. ]()


## Experiment 3 Results

Experiment 3 tested V1515 alloy.

Lower power melt tracks for Experiment 3 are shown in [Experiment 3 optical microscope images of melt tracks for lower powers, 20X lens 100um scale. a) to h) showing the different track reference numbers and their corresponding laser parameters.]()
Higher power melt tracks are shown in [Experiment 3 using Olympus BX51 microscope with Clemex Vision images of melt tracks for higher power, 20X lens 100um scale. i) to n) showing the different track reference numbers and their corresponding laser parameters.]()
For the SEM of Experiment 3, analysis was performed on the highest and lowest power settings, as well as a mid-range power. 
The SEM images are shown in [SEM imaging of Experiment 3 cross section, a) 3-1 SE mag 10000 x, b) 3-1 SE mag 10000 x, c) 3-6 SE mag 1000 x, d) 3-6 SE mag 40000 x, e) 3-16 SE mag 500 x, f) 3-16 SE mag 2500 x,  g) 3-16 SE mag 10000 x, h) 3-16 SE mag 10000 x ]()
